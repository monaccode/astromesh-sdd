## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- New logo: an isometric stack of three slabs (spec, plan, tasks) with a check on top, crossed
  by a violet traceability line through the corner of every step, in the Astromesh orbit
  family. Replaces the page-based mark that read too close to Astromesh OKF.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Seven Spec-Driven Development skills in the open Agent Skills format: `sdd` (cycle and
  routing), `sdd-constitution`, `sdd-specify`, `sdd-plan`, `sdd-tasks`, `sdd-implement`,
  `sdd-verify`, with templates for every artifact.
- Claude Code plugin and one-plugin marketplace (`astromesh-sdd@astromesh`).
- `install.sh` and `install.ps1` for Claude Code, `.agents/skills` agents (Codex CLI,
  OpenCode, Kimi Code, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot) and `AGENTS.md`.
- Customization through `.sdd/`: `config.yaml`, template overrides, per-phase rules and
  custom phases (`templates/my-phase`), with an example folder and `docs/extending.md`.
- Per-platform install guide with the official source for every path.
- Worked example `examples/specs/001-slugify-title`, produced by the skills.

Tested before release: the full cycle (specify → verify, PASS) in Claude Code from
`.claude/skills`; specify and plan in OpenCode from `.agents/skills`, with the `.claude`
copy removed. Kimi Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI and GitHub Copilot are installed to their
documented paths but not yet run end to end. Installers tested in CI on Linux, macOS and
Windows.
